# .vimrc
My `.vimrc` and `init.vim` file. The first one is old and more or less deprecated. Both support NeoVim.

# Usage
You need to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) manually beforehand. Additional dependencies for `init.vim`, as well as neovim API packages for NodeJS and Python are listed in `.config/nvim/dependencies.md`. Then:

1) Copy the file to your system.
2) Run Vim.

# DISCLAIMER
If you've come here from any of [these posts](https://habr.com/ru/users/hovushka/posts/), search for the relevant version of the config in the commit history.
